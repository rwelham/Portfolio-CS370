# Portfolio-CS370

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
``The purpose of this project was to create an AI agent that could progress through a maze to find treasure within. The agent would act as an opponent to a human player. The code originally given had everything set and created aside from the q-training algorithm which I programmed to allow the agent to move about the game and learn from its movements along with keeping track of how many epochs would be best for its learning.``

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

``Computer Scientists program, create, and keep up with different technologies for the hope of innovation and making tools that people can use and want to use.``

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

``As a computer science student, I like to approach my problems methodically and systematically. The first part of any project is understanding what the specifications and requirements are required for a project. From there I then breakdown what needs to be fixed into different parts that can be fixed. Finally, I work on each piece of the problem, making sure to test after integrating anything new into the solution.``

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

``My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization is to not willingly do harm to the user or organization through projects I am working on.``
